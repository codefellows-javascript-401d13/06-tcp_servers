======

### About the chat server:

  - This interactive chat server uses TCP sockets which allows multiple users to interact in a simple terminal window. The client should be able to connect to the server through telnet with their IP address that is being served on the local port.

### How to run the application:
- User must have a terminal program to run commands
- User must have npm installed for node uuid as well as node.js

        Go to the root directory and type: node server.js(serving on PORT 3000)


### How to connect to the server:
        Open another terminal window and type telnet and your 'IP address 3000'
        This connects your server to the IP address allowing communication between
        sockets
